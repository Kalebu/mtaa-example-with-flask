# mtaa-example-with-flask

A minimal flask application showing you how you can use mtaa in your web application.

<img src = "mtaa_example_with_flask.png" height="350" width="600"></img>

It uses JQuery to send requests to fetch locations from flask routes without refreshing the page

## Getting started

You need to clone the repository or download manually

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kalebu/mtaa-example-with-flask
